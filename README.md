Forecasting portfolio return using AR, MA, ARIMA models

In Assignment 1, we are going to predict the portfolio returns using time series analysis models viz AR & MA. The portfolio is exposed to gold and equity with the underlying securities NIFTYBEES & GOLDBEES. The descriptive statistical analysis is performed on the return series of this portfolio and then returns are forecasted using the AR & MA model following the steps given in the class. Also, these forecasted results from R have again been worked out in excel.
